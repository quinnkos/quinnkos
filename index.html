                                <p>Music has been a part of my life ever since I began learning piano at age 3.
                                    Throughout my childhood, my interests and abilities evolved.
                                    Around age 9 or 10, I began learning guitar and attending frequent music camps to
                                    play and compose music with other young musicians. At age 10, I also began producing
                                    songs electronically on programs like GarageBand. Entering high school, and throughout
                                    the pandemic and the years that followed, electronic music production has remained my
                                    primary passion (plus some jazz piano on the side). At age 17, amidst an intense college
                                    application season, I co-produced, mixed and mastered six songs for MasterChef
                                    winner and musical hobbyist Dino Angelo Luciano. While I'm at college in Santa Barbara, 
                                    I continue to play guitar, especially the acoustic.

                                    properties, and impact on player movement, as well as the characteristics of the player itself. More

                                <p>This tool uses data from past U.S. presidential elections and implements randomization
                                    and Gaussian distributions to simulate realistic alternate outcomes. It allows users to
                                    dictate the extent to which the simulated results can vary from the true ones.
                                    My favorite part of this
                                    program is the live map of the simulation results (see video above). The map depends on a
                                    feature I implemented that predicts when a state will be projected based on
                                    how narrow the race is and when the polls in that state close.

                                <h4>AI Chess Bot</h4>
                                <p>In March 2021, I abruptly developed a strong interest in chess. For the next year, I
                                    studied chess strategy and theory and practiced daily through competitive play on chess.com
                                    (at one point, my competitive Elo rating was greater than 99.7% of players on the site).
                                    I even played an in-person tournament in San Francisco, beating a previous tournament winner.
                                    To complement my obsession with chess, I developed an interest in chess-focused programming
                                    and compiled several projects to support my studies and build my algorithms and data science skills.
                                    One of said projects was this AI Chess bot, written in Python. Building this tool was tricky because it required
                                    analysis of thousands of hypothetical move sequences and evaluate resulting board positions at each turn, and
                                    Python is notoriously slow. Hence, I had to find ways to speed up my algorithm and reduce node visits to enable
                                    deeper computer analysis of promising moves. These strategies included alpha-beta pruning, a preliminary search function, a
                                    transposition table, late move reduction, and MVV-LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Aggressor).

                                <p> In this team project, I built a model to identify optimal exercise times for students at UC Santa Barbara based on
                                    their schedules and the busyness of the school’s Recreation Center.
                                    To accomplish this, I conducted exploratory data analysis and wrote a series of scripts with
                                    Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib that utilized time series data from the Recreation Center to forecast busyness
                                    though Poisson Regression. My team and I placed in the Top 8 out of 53 teams in Data Science UCSB’s 2024 Project Series
                                    and presented our work to industry professionals at the club’s 2024 Project Showcase.</p>
